What topic should I choose?
For this year I'll be doing Terrorism for another game idea.

Game Name: Bataille de bombes
You need to defuse bombs but they have different modules that you need to solve before their completed
I will use a class for the majority of this program that will store the modules and "issues"
The modules will have questions that I had in my Java Fundmentals class 
These will range from easy questions like count all spaces to count all letters in under 12 seconds.

If you win another random module gets added until you die or reach level 6. (Add endless mode?)

You can't pick which module you want to do first

| Example: Working on a module |
Modules left: 2 (Including this one)
Current Module working on: Counting

I fly on the marrow as quick as a sparrow. As I wright on the court I find it very pleasing.

Task: Count all spaces

| Example: Game introduction |
Agent...There's been a problem
Terrorists have infiltrated HQ and have placed multiple Explosive Devices
You're our only hope

Press Enter to continue...
